# Hi everyone, I’m Francesca! 👩‍💻
I'm a Ph.D. student at the final year of my program in <i> [Advances in Infectious Diseases, Microbiology, Legal Medicine and Public Health Sciences](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/ADVANCES-IN-INFECTIOUS-DISEASES,-MICROBIOLOGY,-LEGAL-MEDICINE-AND-PUBLIC-HEALTH-SCIENCES_nD3763_EN.aspx)</i> at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home) (Italy). <br>

I am part of Prof. [Maria Pia Conte](https://dspmi.uniroma1.it/node/5640)’s research group at the [Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases](https://dspmi.uniroma1.it), where my research is focused on unraveling the complex relationship between microbial organisms and human health through the lens of bioinformatics.

## My Research 🦠 
In my research, I primarily focus on analyzing microbial genomic and metagenomic data, using a range of bioinformatics softwares and programming languages. <br>

I am also interested in the methodological and interdisciplinary aspects of this field. This involves learning how to generate data (e.g., through genome sequencing technologies) and understanding the mathematical foundations, statistical models, and computational techniques behind the bioinformatics tools used in my analyses.

## Outside the Lab ✨
When I’m not immersed in research, I love to travel, explore new cuisines, and training for obstances course races. New experiences and challenges are what truly spark my curiosity.
